## DESIGN

**FREECAD**

Freecad is a free software package for 3D drawing. https://www.freecad.org/
It lets you draw with precision, it also lets you define distance constraints (such as fixing holes).
But so much more :)

Personally, I use it to draw the module's outer contour and fixing holes.
Then I insert it into Inkscape to create a 2D vector design with easy image and font insertion.

You will find it in the 2D files folder.

**INKSCAPE**

Inkscape is a free 2D vectoriel drawing software. https://inkscape.org/
Inkscape lets me align holes of defined diameters for knob, switch, jacks, leds ... And, we also can play with fonts, pictures and much more... :)

You'll find in the 2D files folder.

**KICAD**

Kicad is a free software for creating pcb. https://www.kicad.org/
It is common to obtain front panels using this software.

My method :

1 - I use Freecad to create the exact eurorack exterior dimensions.
4, 6, 8 HP etc... With the mounting holes in the right place!

2 - I insert the file into inkscape to put the writing, images, markers etc..

3 - I insert the file in Kicad, and define each drawing or writing on a layer of the PCB.

## FABRICATION

To obtain the next front panels you'll need a lasercutter. Like 3d printer you can find it in a fablab.

**Lasergraving Dibond**

3mm dibond = Dibond® is an aluminum composite material (ACM). It is comprised of two pre-painted sheets of . 012″ (. 30mm) aluminum with a solid polyethylene core.

Most easy-to-find machines cannot engrave in aluminum.
But aluminum is painted, so engraving works in place of cutting.
However, you'll need to drill the holes with a drill press and cut the edge precisely.
But it's functional, and inexpensive, as sports clubs use this material for their advertising.
As their sponsors change, they no longer use the old panels...
On one side there's the advertising, on the other it's blank, ready to engrave, sometimes even with the protective layer still on :)

**Lasergraving Aluminium**

Most easy-to-find machines cannot engrave in aluminum.
But aluminum can be painted, so engraving works in place of cutting.
But, you do need to protect the paint, however, as it will peel off. One solution is to apply a layer of transparent plastic adhesive.

However, you'll need to drill the holes with a drill press and cut the edge precisely.

**Etch PCB**

To obtain this quality of fabrication - Not the design :) - you'll need to send GERBER files to a PCB supplyer.

**3d print**

It's also possible to 3d print the front panel. 
I use 3d panel only for blank panel

This website allows you to download and print eurorack parts.
