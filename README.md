## DESIGN

**FREECAD**
Freecad is a free software package for 3D drawing.
https://www.freecad.org/
It lets you draw with precision.
It also lets you define distance constraints (such as fixing holes).
But so much more :)

Personally, I use it to draw the module's outer contour and fixing holes.
Then I insert it into Inkscape to create a 2D vector design with easy image and font insertion.

You will find it in the 3D files folder.

**INKSCAPE**
Inkscape is a free 2D vectoriel drawing software.
https://inkscape.org/
Inkscape lets me align holes of defined diameters, play with fonts and much more... :)

You'll find in the 2D files folder.
You can modify anything :)

**Kicad**
Kicad is a free software for creating pcb.
https://www.kicad.org/
It is now very easy to obtain front panels using this software.

My method
1 - I use Freecad to create the exact eurorack exterior dimensions.
4, 6, 8 HP etc... With the mounting holes in the right place!
2 - I insert the file into inkscape to put the writing, images, markers etc..
3 - I insert the file in Kicad, and define each drawing or writing on a layer of the PCB.
